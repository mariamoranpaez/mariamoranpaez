# Hello ðŸ‘‹

As an experienced technology professional, I have specialized as a computer technician. Over the years, I have worked in various projects and environments, which has strengthened my technical skills and solution-focused mindset.

Recently, I have decided to expand my horizons and dive into the world of web development. I am immersed in a continuous learning process, exploring programming languages such as JavaScript, as well as styling languages such as CSS and markup languages such as HTML. This change of focus has given me a new perspective and renewed enthusiasm for my professional career.

In addition, I am dabbling in the Shopify field, gaining skills in online store design and customization. This experience complements my profile as an evolving web developer, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the digital ecosystem and e-commerce.

My goal is to merge my previous experience in information technology with my new skills in web development to create innovative and efficient solutions that drive success for both my clients and my career.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in a web desing project.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning javaScript. 
ðŸ”­ Self-taught in shopify.
